## Conclusions

- This shiny application is made with an objective of helping people in search of temporary accommodation to identify places with the lowest crime rate in the neighborhood. As of now our app only plots the AirBnb listings in Seattle, but we plan to expand our project and allow users to plot the crime statistics along with available accomodations with a click of a button. With our app, we are trying to help users make informed choices with respect to their safety at the place they plan to live at. Furthermore, we think that our application will be one of its kind as no current application takes into account this essential measure of safety.

- By conducting research, we found out that there was a direct relationship between the amount of criminal activities at a place and the tourist attraction at that place. The places with the most criminal activity were the places with most tourist attractions (Example - places like U-District and Capitol Hill). This suggests that people looking for a safe environment should avoid these areas for finding temporary accommodations.
