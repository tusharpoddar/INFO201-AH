      in metropolitan areas like New York, Washington D.C, and Seattle. Every person

      to stay that meets all of their preferences and financial needs. Sometimes this means
      finding a place to stay with an optimal location to tourist attractions. This comes with 
      safety risks in largely populated areas. It is important for users to know all of these 
      safety risks when booking to ensure the quality of customer care given by Airbnb."),

      are looking to stay. They are susceptible to choosing a place to stay that is filled
      with crime without this information which may lead them to unforeseen danger. Because
      crime rates are higher in big cities, especially in areas where many tourist attractions

      by their entire vacation, not just by their experience with booking. A vacation can turn 
      unsafe if a person and their family are faced with crime. There is an ethical responsibility

      listing's particular location. We will potentially include some other information about the
      listingâ€™s location, like the proximity to popular attractions. This will allow users of Airbnb
      to have as much information as possible when booking so that they can weigh their options about
      which listing to book, potentially keeping them out of harms way during their travels."),
